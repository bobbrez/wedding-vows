## I. GATHERING WORDS

Welcome! Good afternoon, family and friends of Bob and Galia.
(--Gary introduces himself.--)
We have come here today to celebrate the wedding
of Galia Truab and Robert Breznak.

On behalf of Bob and Galia, thank you for joining us.
They are privileged to share this special day with you, their family and friends,
and thank each of you for making the journey here.

By your presence, you celebrate with them
the love they have discovered in each other,
and you support their decision to commit themselves to a lifelong relationship.
Marriage is a bond to be entered into only after considerable thought and reflection.
By making this commitment today, Bob and Galia’s relationship
will become stronger, better, and deeper.
Today, Bob and Galia demonstrate their devotion to each other
by dedicating themselves to a life together.
They show their respect and love for each other
by declaring before you their desire to honor the vows they have created.
Today, their lives, which began on separate paths, will be officially, and joyously joined as one.

We gather here to witness, not the beginning of a journey, but a continuation of a
journey that began seven years ago. Today they invite you  to walk along with them
on part of that journey. We celebrate not what will be, but what already is!

## II. ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF FAMILY & FRIENDS

Today represents not only the joining of Bob and Galia,
but also the joining of their families and friends.
Bob and Galia would like to recognize their parents on this occasion.
(-- GP: Should the parents / grandparents be invited to stand? --)
(-- BB: Since they'll be walking in as apart of the ceremony it will be fine. They'll be asked to stand again during introductions at the reception. --)
They offer their profound gratitude
for all the love and care you, their parents, showed in raising them.
Parents, the unconditional gifts of love and support
that you have continually offered
have inspired them to become who they are today,
and they thank you, from the bottom of their hearts.
Without you, this day would not be possible.

As much as today is a celebration of Bob and Galia’s marriage,
it is also a celebration of their love,
which is built upon the experiences of not only the seven years they have known each other,
but the experience and values that they bring into this union that come from you (the parents and family).

## III. REMEMBRANCES & ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Bob and Galia have also asked that we take a moment  of silence
To honor those loved ones who are not with us today

    [Moment of silence]

## IV. MARRIAGE ADDRESS

(-- GP: Do you want me to read this or should it be read by one of the wedding party?? --)
(-- BB: I think that having someone read it would be nice. We can determine that @ the rehersal. --)

### Union by Robert Fulghum
You have known each other from the first glance of acquaintance to this point of commitment. At some point, you decided to marry. From that moment of yes, to this moment of yes, indeed, you have been making commitments in an informal way. All of those conversations that were held in a car, or over a meal, or during long walks – all those conversations that began with, “When we’re married”, and continued with “I will” and “you will” and “we will” – all those late night talks that included “someday” and “somehow” and “maybe” – and all those promises that are unspoken matters of the heart. All these common things, and more, are the real process of a wedding.

The symbolic vows that you are about to make are a way of saying to one another, “You know all those things that we’ve promised, and hoped, and dreamed – well, I meant it all, every word.”

Look at one another and remember this moment in time. Before this moment you have been many things to one another – acquaintance, friend, companion, lover, dancing partner, even teacher, for you have learned much from one another these past few years. Shortly you shall say a few words that will take you across a threshold of life, and things between you will never quite be the same.

For after today you shall say to the world –
This is my husband. This is my wife.

```The section below should be reworded / replaced with whatver GPollice wants to add about marrage.```

(-- GP: Now, do you want me to write in my comments or do you want to have some surprise? --)
(-- BB: Ideally it would be great as a surprise, but practically I'd like to see what you've got written. I've got a feeling that we'll both be nervous so trying to absorb and comprehend may be a bit difficult. Plus, familuarity will help cut down on the nervousness. --)

##V. GROUP DECLARATION OF SUPPORT

Now, I ask that these friends and family stand,
And that you turn and acknowledge them, as they acknowledge you.

    [Audience stands]

As family and friends,
you form a community of support
that surrounds Bob and Galia
each of you, by your presence here today
is called upon to uphold them in loving each other.

Always stand beside them, never between them.
Offer them your love and your support,
not your judgment.

Encourage them when encouragement is needed
and listen to them when they ask for advice.

In these ways, you can honor this marriage
in which they are joined today.

Do you offer your love and support
to strengthen their marriage
And bless this family created by their union?

Please answer by saying : WE DO

    [Guests: WE DO]

Thank you, you may be seated.

    [Audience sits]

## VI. VOWS

Then please turn to each other and share the vows you have written.

    [Galia's Vows]
    [Bob’s Vows]

## VII. RING EXCHANGE

For thousands of years
lovers have exchanged rings as a token of their love.
Let these rings be a sign that love has a past, a present, and a future
through you and within you.

```~ Like each other, each ring has been made unique by each other's presence.```

(-- GP: Comment about the uniqueness of the rings, the fingerprints? --)
(-- BB: Yep. Not really sure exactly what to say though... --)

Now Bob, please take Galia’s hands, palms up, so you may see the gift that they are to you:
These are the hands of your best friend, smooth, young, and carefree,
that are holding yours on your wedding day,
as she promises to love you all the days of her life.

Bob, take Galia’s ring and place it on her finger and repeat after me:

I give you this ring as a sign that I choose you to be my lover, my partner and my best friend, 
to the end of my days. Wear it, think of me, and know that I love you.

Galia, take Bob’s ring and place it on his finger and repeat after me:

I give you this ring as a sign that I choose you to be my lover, my partner and my best friend,
to the end of my days. Wear it, think of me, and know that I love you

## IX. BEER CEREMONY
In this wine ceremony, a single glass of beer is placed on a table, from which both the Bride and Groom will both drink after the reading.

In this glass are the fruits of Creation, Mankind and Mother Earth. The years of our lives are like a cup of beer that is poured out for the sake of labor, honor and love. Many days you will sit at the same table and eat and drink together. Many are the experiences you will share.

As with a glass of beer, one of you may find it sweet, the other perhaps bitter or somehow different. Let the drink you share today serve as a reminder that although you may perceive things very differently, being right is never more important than being happy. With this space that you give each other, always putting your commitment to love and honor one another first, your lives together will grow deeper, richer and greatly satisfying, like a hearty beer. You may now drink from this fountain of love. 

`` Couple gives each other a drink from the same glass ``

## VII. PRONOUNCEMENT
Bob and Galia, we have heard your promise to share your lives in marriage.
We recognize and respect the vows you have made here this day
before each one of us as a witness.

In the honesty and sincerity of what you have said and done here today,
and in accordance with the laws of the state of Massachusetts
It is my honor and delight to declare you henceforth to be husband and wife 

    [Bob & Galia kiss]

## IX. BENEDICTION

Now, may the love that has brought you together
continue to grow and enrich your lives.
May you meet with courage the problems that arise to challenge you.
And may your relationship always be one of love and trust.

May the happiness you share today be with you always.
And may every word you have pledged here be a living truth in your lives.
