## I. GATHERING WORDS

Welcome! Good afternoon, family and friends of Bob and Galia.
(--Gary introduces himself.--)
We have come here today to celebrate the wedding
of Galia Truab and Robert Breznak.

On behalf of Bob and Galia, thank you for joining us.
They are privileged to share this special day with you, their family and friends,
and thank each of you for making the journey here.

By your presence, you celebrate with them
the love they have discovered in each other,
and you support their decision to commit themselves to a lifelong relationship.
Marriage is a bond to be entered into only after considerable thought and reflection.
By making this commitment today, Bob and Galia’s relationship
will become stronger, better, and deeper.
Today, Bob and Galia demonstrate their devotion to each other
by dedicating themselves to a life together.
They show their respect and love for each other
by declaring before you their desire to honor the vows they have created.
Today, their lives, which began on separate paths, will be officially, and joyously joined as one.

We gather here to witness, not the beginning of a journey, but a continuation of a
journey that began seven years ago. Today they invite you  to walk along with them
on part of that journey. We celebrate not what will be, but what already is!

```+^ "We are gathered here, not to witness the beginning of what will be, but rather what already is! "]```

## II. ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF FAMILY & FRIENDS

Today represents not only the joining of Bob and Galia,
but also the joining of their families and friends.
Bob and Galia would like to recognize their parents on this occasion.
(--Should the parents / grandparents be invited to stand?--)
They offer their profound gratitude
for all the love and care you, their parents, showed in raising them.
Parents, the unconditional gifts of love and support
that you have continually offered
have inspired them to become who they are today,
and they thank you, from the bottom of their hearts.
Without you, this day would not be possible.

As much as today is a celebration of Bob and Galia’s marriage,
it is also a celebration of their love,
which is built upon the experiences of not only the seven years they have known each other,
but the experience and values that they bring into this union that come from you (the parents and family).

## III. REMEMBRANCES & ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Bob and Galia have also asked that we take a moment  of silence
To honor those loved ones who are not with us today

    [Moment of silence]

## IV. MARRIAGE ADDRESS

(-- Do you want me to read this or should it be read by one of the wedding party?? --)
### Union by Robert Fulghum
You have known each other from the first glance of acquaintance to this point of commitment. At some point, you decided to marry. From that moment of yes, to this moment of yes, indeed, you have been making commitments in an informal way. All of those conversations that were held in a car, or over a meal, or during long walks – all those conversations that began with, “When we’re married”, and continued with “I will” and “you will” and “we will” – all those late night talks that included “someday” and “somehow” and “maybe” – and all those promises that are unspoken matters of the heart. All these common things, and more, are the real process of a wedding.

The symbolic vows that you are about to make are a way of saying to one another, “You know all those things that we’ve promised, and hoped, and dreamed – well, I meant it all, every word.”

Look at one another and remember this moment in time. Before this moment you have been many things to one another – acquaintance, friend, companion, lover, dancing partner, even teacher, for you have learned much from one another these past few years. Shortly you shall say a few words that will take you across a threshold of life, and things between you will never quite be the same.

For after today you shall say to the world –
This is my husband. This is my wife.


```The section below should be reworded / replaced with whatver GPollice wants to add about marrage.```
(-- Now, do you want me to write in my comments or do you want to have some surprise? --)
Deep abiding affection,
the ```- magical``` and compelling shared impulse that makes us seek each others company,
is among the greatest gifts of the human experience.
Any of us who has been fortunate enough to find and express
the kind of loving devotion that we are celebrating here today
knows that it is an awesome and beautiful thing.

This understanding brings me to the first of three ```~ suggestions```
I will offer to you, Bob & Galia; be constantly grateful for the presence of this precious person
who has chosen to make a life with you.

My second suggestion is this:
Make each other the recipient of daily kindness.
The world can be a tough place and any of us can be subject to rough handling.
Be generous with compliments.
Be attentive and helpful.
Each of you can, by your tenderness toward each other,
kind words and thoughtful actions,
make your marriage and your home an uplifting refuge.

Last, but perhaps most importantly,
make truth the unfailing bedrock of your lives together.
A happy, loving marriage is built on trust and respect.
That trust and respect can only be sustained
if you are both deeply committed to always being open and truthful
in every exchange no matter how small.

My hope for you is this;
that you have many long years to delight in each others company,
to feel gratitude for your great good fortune
in having found and loved each other,
to a make home together that is at once sheltering and welcoming,
to each do meaningful, productive work at home and in the world
to travel with each other and explore the unknown
and to love and be loved by the friends and family
who have come here today to support you…
(-- End of my comments and transition to the next section. --)

##V. GROUP DECLARATION OF SUPPORT

And that you turn and acknowledge them, as they acknowledge you.

Offer them your love and your support,
not your judgment.

Encourage them when encouragement is needed
and listen to them when they ask for advice.

## VII. RING EXCHANGE

For thousands of years
lovers have exchanged rings as a token of their love.
Let these rings be a sign that love has a past, a present, and a future
through you and within you.

```~ Like each other, each ring has been made unique by each other's presence.```
(-- Comment about the uniqueness of the rings, the fingerprints? --)

Now Bob, please take Galia’s hands, palms up, so you may see the gift that they are to you:
These are the hands of your best friend, smooth, young, and carefree,
that are holding yours on your wedding day,
as she promises to love you all the days of her life.

Bob, take Galia’s ring and place it on her finger and repeat after me:

I give you this ring as a sign that I choose you to be my lover, my partner and my best friend, 
to the end of my days. Wear it, think of me, and know that I love you.

Galia, take Bob’s ring and place it on his finger and repeat after me:

I give you this ring as a sign that I choose you to be my lover, my partner and my best friend,
to the end of my days. Wear it, think of me, and know that I love you
