## I. GATHERING WORDS

Welcome! Good afternoon, family and friends of Bob and Galia.
(--Gary introduces himself.--)
We have come here today to celebrate the wedding
of Galia Truab and Robert Breznak.

On behalf of Bob and Galia, thank you for joining us.
They are privileged to share this special day with you, their family and friends,
and thank each of you for making the journey here.

By your presence, you celebrate with them
the love they have discovered in each other,
and you support their decision to commit themselves to a lifelong relationship.
Marriage is a bond to be entered into only after considerable thought and reflection.
By making this commitment today, Bob and Galia’s relationship
will become stronger, better, and deeper.
Today, Bob and Galia demonstrate their devotion to each other
by dedicating themselves to a life together.
They show their respect and love for each other
by declaring before you their desire to honor the vows they have created.
Today, their lives, which began on separate paths, will be officially, and joyously joined as one.

We gather here to witness, not the beginning of a journey, but a continuation of a
journey that began seven years ago. Today they invite you  to walk along with them
on part of that journey. We celebrate not what will be, but what already is!

## II. ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF FAMILY & FRIENDS

Today represents not only the joining of Bob and Galia,
but also the joining of their families and friends.
Bob and Galia would like to recognize their parents on this occasion.
(-- GP: Should the parents / grandparents be invited to stand? --)
(-- BB: Since they'll be walking in as apart of the ceremony it will be fine. They'll be asked to stand again during introductions at the reception. --)
They offer their profound gratitude
for all the love and care you, their parents, showed in raising them.
Parents, the unconditional gifts of love and support
that you have continually offered
have inspired them to become who they are today,
and they thank you, from the bottom of their hearts.
Without you, this day would not be possible.

As much as today is a celebration of Bob and Galia’s marriage,
it is also a celebration of their love,
which is built upon the experiences of not only the seven years they have known each other,
but the experience and values that they bring into this union that come from you (the parents and family).

## III. REMEMBRANCES & ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Bob and Galia have also asked that we take a moment  of silence
To honor those loved ones who are not with us today

## IV. MARRIAGE ADDRESS

(-- GP: Do you want me to read this or should it be read by one of the wedding party?? --)
(-- BB: I think that having someone read it would be nice. We can determine that @ the rehersal. --)

### Union by Robert Fulghum
You have known each other from the first glance of acquaintance to this point of commitment. At some point, you decided to marry. From that moment of yes, to this moment of yes, indeed, you have been making commitments in an informal way. All of those conversations that were held in a car, or over a meal, or during long walks – all those conversations that began with, “When we’re married”, and continued with “I will” and “you will” and “we will” – all those late night talks that included “someday” and “somehow” and “maybe” – and all those promises that are unspoken matters of the heart. All these common things, and more, are the real process of a wedding.

The symbolic vows that you are about to make are a way of saying to one another, “You know all those things that we’ve promised, and hoped, and dreamed – well, I meant it all, every word.”

Look at one another and remember this moment in time. Before this moment you have been many things to one another – acquaintance, friend, companion, lover, dancing partner, even teacher, for you have learned much from one another these past few years. Shortly you shall say a few words that will take you across a threshold of life, and things between you will never quite be the same.

For after today you shall say to the world –
This is my husband. This is my wife.

```The section below should be reworded / replaced with whatver GPollice wants to add about marrage.```

Galia and Bob. By now I'm sure that you've received words of wisdom about the wonders, joys, difficulties, 
ups, downs, rewards, sacrifices, and every other possible topic, that can remotely be applied to marriage. 
Some of these may be helpful and some not so helpful. You could probably take the advice and write the complete 
marriage owner's manual. And it would be as good as any other book on successful marriage. Because all of the 
advice people offer, good and bad, are absolutely true — for the people who offered them to you.

But they are not you. You, the Galia and Bob standing here today, are unique. You came in here as two people, 
a couple, ready to commit to a deeper, more intimate union. When you exit from this ceremony you will be 
different than when you came in. You will still be Galia and Bob, unique, wonderful individuals, but you 
will be Galia and Bob, the unique product of this union — and that is the wonder of marriage.

It is an "Oh wow!" wonder. As I thought about this and what advice I might offer you today, my thoughts 
were drawn the last words of Steve Jobs, the late founder of Apple Computer. According to reports his last 
words were "Oh wow! Oh wow! Oh wow!" Many people have been wondering what this really meant. Did Jobs have 
a mystical experience at the end of this life? Did he see his life pass by and realize all of the joys he 
experienced — or perhaps all of the sorrows and things he missed. We'll never know for sure. But this made 
me think about the "Oh wow!" moments that I've experienced in my marriage. Some are the obvious ones: 
these include the day I married the love of my life, the day our son was born, the joy of welcoming 
grandchildren, and so on. You can't help but be aware of these moments, but there are so many more, and they 
are so easy to miss.

How can you avoid missing them? I offer to you the following suggestions and wishes.

For each of us, life is a journey. You two have chosen to walk together on the journey. There will 
be times when each of you will take side trips to explore things that interest you; but you will never be 
too far from the main path that both of you walk. This is good and normal. When we venture on any trip, we 
make plans and look ahead, focusing on the destination--the ultimate goal. When we do this however, too often 
we miss what is, because we continue to look for what will be.

My hope for you is that you enjoy the trip – the wondrous adventures — rather than just focusing on the 
destination, because the destination will change. Where you think you are headed today may be far away 
from where you will be. But the true joy of any trip is the trip itself. And experiencing the trip together 
is the real wonder.

Be aware of, and be present to each other. How can you tell when two people are in love? Early in a relationship 
one sees actions that normally occur during an initial infatuation phase. The unwillingness to be  part. 
The need for constant contact with each other. We've all been there, and for most of us we have gone past that. 
Think of parents, grandparents, and others who have seemingly been in love forever. Each of these loves is 
unique and undeniable. There are certainly childish, playful moments. Moments of great passion. But the basis 
of their love is their ability to cherish those common, ordinary moments, of each day and to be thankful for 
the love they have at each and every one of those moments. This is the bedrock foundation of true love upon 
which deep, meaningful lives are built. This is the love I wish for you.

So, finally, I wish for you the gift of reflection; the ability to reflect at the end of each day and think 
of those times of the ordinary, the common, and the often unexciting. And when you reflect upon these things 
that you are able to see each other — a glance, a touch, or quiet moment when you were in each other's 
presence — and recognize the love between you.

And when you do reflect and see the common, ordinary, and comfort that you can say "Oh wow! Oh wow! Oh wow!"

##V. GROUP DECLARATION OF SUPPORT

Now, I ask that these friends and family stand,
And that you turn and acknowledge them, as they acknowledge you.

    [Audience stands]

As family and friends,
you form a community of support
that surrounds Bob and Galia
each of you, by your presence here today
is called upon to uphold them in loving each other.

Always stand beside them, never between them.
Offer them your love and your support,
not your judgment.

Encourage them when encouragement is needed
and listen to them when they ask for advice.

In these ways, you can honor this marriage
in which they are joined today.

Do you offer your love and support
to strengthen their marriage
And bless this family created by their union?

Please answer by saying : WE DO

    [Guests: WE DO]

Thank you, you may be seated.

    [Audience sits]

## VI. VOWS

Then please turn to each other and share the vows you have written.

    [Galia's Vows

### Bob’s Vows
Galia,

I cherish your personality. While I do not know what the future holds for us, I know that I can promise I will be your companion.

Together we have gone from dorms to apartments; From Vegas to Venice; and from beaches to emergency rooms. During this time, I've seen who you are.

Your curiosity and drive to explore the unknown has enriched our lives. I vow that I will be at your side as we push ourselves to travel and explore. I vow that I will keep us fresh by seeking new experiences. And I vow that I will be equally diligent about keeping our passions alive.

Your compassion for others is unlike any other. There are innumerable examples of where you befriended those who others would not. You even managed to put up with me. I vow that I will mirror the love that you show me everyday. I vow that I will always listen and be a confidant for you. And I vow that will support your efforts to make meaningful change.

Your candor challenges and matures my thoughts. In our short time together, I have laid out a new half-baked idea. Probably daily. I love that you are both my toughest critic and biggest advocate. I am better for it. I vow that I will always listen, but likewise will always be honest. Tactful, but honest. I vow that, at times, I will disagree and will challenge you. I vow that I will also let you be unreasonable when you need to be.

Your contagious demeanor. Anyone who has ever come in contact with you can attest to feeling a little bit cheerful afterwards. While you are realistic, you can find the only ray of sunshine on an otherwise bleak day. I vow to reflect your demeanor when you need it and to amplify it whenever I can. I vow that I will take time to find joy in our little moments as well as milestones. And I vow that I will do all that I can to build a hopeful future with you.

Galia. Thank you for everything that you've been to me so far and everything that we will be in the future. Geronimo.

Oh. And one more thing.

I love you.

## VII. RING EXCHANGE

For thousands of years
lovers have exchanged rings as a token of their love.
Let these rings be a sign that love has a past, a present, and a future
through you and within you.

```~ Like each other, each ring has been made unique by each other's presence.```

(-- GP: Comment about the uniqueness of the rings, the fingerprints? --)
(-- BB: Yep. Not really sure exactly what to say though... --)

Now Bob, please take Galia’s hands, palms up, so you may see the gift that they are to you:
These are the hands of your best friend, smooth, young, and carefree,
that are holding yours on your wedding day,
as she promises to love you all the days of her life.

Bob, take Galia’s ring and place it on her finger and repeat after me:

I give you this ring as a sign that I choose you to be my lover, my partner and my best friend, 
to the end of my days. Wear it, think of me, and know that I love you.

Galia, take Bob’s ring and place it on his finger and repeat after me:

I give you this ring as a sign that I choose you to be my lover, my partner and my best friend,
to the end of my days. Wear it, think of me, and know that I love you

## IX. BEER CEREMONY
In this glass are the fruits of Creation, Mankind and Mother Earth. The years of our lives are like a cup of beer that is poured out for the sake of labor, honor and love. Many days you will sit at the same table and eat and drink together. Many are the experiences you will share.

As with a glass of beer, one of you may find it sweet, the other perhaps bitter or somehow different. Let the drink you share today serve as a reminder that although you may perceive things very differently, being right is never more important than being happy. With this space that you give each other, always putting your commitment to love and honor one another first, your lives together will grow deeper, richer and greatly satisfying, like a hearty beer. You may now drink from this fountain of love. 

`` Couple gives each other a drink from the same glass ``

## VII. PRONOUNCEMENT
Bob and Galia, we have heard your promise to share your lives in marriage.
We recognize and respect the vows you have made here this day
before each one of us as a witness.

In the honesty and sincerity of what you have said and done here today,
and in accordance with the laws of the state of Massachusetts
It is my honor and delight to declare you henceforth to be husband and wife 

    [Bob & Galia kiss]

## IX. BENEDICTION

Now, may the love that has brought you together
continue to grow and enrich your lives.
May you meet with courage the problems that arise to challenge you.
And may your relationship always be one of love and trust.

May the happiness you share today be with you always.
And may every word you have pledged here be a living truth in your lives.
