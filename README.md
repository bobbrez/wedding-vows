## I. GATHERING WORDS 
Welcome! Good afternoon, family and friends We have come here today to celebrate the wedding of Galia Truab and Robert Breznak
On behalf of Bob and Galia, thank you for joining us They are privileged to share this special day with you, their family and friends, And thank each of you for making the journey here By your presence, you celebrate with them and the love they have discovered in each other
 And you support their decision to commit themselves to a lifelong relationship
Marriage is a bond to be entered into only after considerable thought and reflection. 
By making this commitment today, Bob and Galia’s relationship will become stronger, better, and deeper. Today, Bob and Galia demonstrate their devotion to each other By dedicating themselves to a life together And they show their respect for each other By setting forth to honor the vows they have created. Today, their lives, which began on separate paths, will be officially joined as one
["We are gathered here, not to witness the beginning of what will be, but rather what already is! "]

## II. ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF FAMILY & FRIENDS
 Today represents not only the joining of Bob and Galia But also the joining of their families and friends
Bob and Galia would like to recognize their parents on this occasion, They offer their profound gratitude For all the love and care their parents showed in raising them. Parents, the unconditional gifts of love and support That you have continually offered Have inspired them to become who they are today, And they thank you, from the bottom of their hearts, Without you, this day would not be possible.
As much as today it is a celebration of Bob and Galia’s marriage, It is also a celebration of their love, Which is built upon the last seven years they have spent together And all the experiences encompassed in [more and a quarter of their lives spent together]

## III. REMEMBRANCES & ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
 Bob and Galia have also asked that we take a moment  of silence  To honor those loved ones who are not with us today

    [Moment of silence]

## IV. MARRIAGE ADDRESS 
Deep abiding affection, the [magical] and compelling shared impulse that makes us seek each others company, is among the greatest gifts of the human experience. Any of us who has been fortunate enough to find and express the kind of loving devotion that we are celebrating here today knows that it is an awesome and beautiful thing.
This understanding brings me to the first of three [suggestions] I will offer to you, Bob & Galia; be constantly grateful for the presence of this precious person who has chosen to make a life with you.
My second suggestion is this: Make each other the recipient of daily kindness. The world can be a tough place and any of us can be subject to rough handling. Be generous with compliments. Be attentive and helpful. Each of you can, by your tenderness toward each other, kind words and thoughtful actions, make your marriage and your home an uplifting refuge.
Last, but perhaps most importantly, make truth the unfailing bedrock of your lives together. A happy, loving marriage is built on trust and respect. That trust and respect can only be sustained if you are both deeply committed to always being open and truthful in every exchange no matter how small.
My hope for you is this; that you have many long years to delight in each others company, to feel gratitude for your great good fortune in having found and loved each other, to a make home together that is at once sheltering and welcoming, to each do meaningful, productive work at home and in the world
to travel with each other and explore the unknown and to love and be loved by the friends and family who have come here today to support you…

##V. GROUP DECLARATION OF SUPPORT Now, I ask that these friends and family stand, And that you turn and acknowledge them, as they acknowledge you
[Audience stands]
As family and friends, You form a community of support That surrounds Bob and Galia Each of you, by your presence here today Is being called upon To uphold them in loving each other
Always stand beside them, never between them Offer them your love and your support Not your judgment Encourage them when encouragement is needed And listen to them when they ask for advice
In these ways, you can honor this marriage Into which they have come to be joined today
Do you offer your love and support To strengthen their marriage And bless this family created by their union?
Please answer by saying : WE DO
[Guests: WE DO]
Thank you, you may be seated.
[Audience sits]

## VI. VOWS 
Then please turn to each other and share the vows you have written.

    [Galia's Vows]
    [Bob’s Vows] 
## VII. RING EXCHANGE
 For thousands of years, Lovers have exchanged rings as a token of their vows Let these rings be a sign that love has a past, a present, and a future Through you and within you.
[Like each other, each ring has been made unique by each other's presence.] 
[Now Bob, please take Galia’s hands, palms up, so you may see the gift that they are to you:
These are the hands of your best friend, smooth, young, and carefree, that are holding yours on your wedding day, as she promises to love you all the days of her life.]

Bob, take Galia’s ring and place it on her finger and repeat after me:
I give you this ring as a sign that I choose you To be my lover, my partner and my best friend, to the end of my days Wear it, think of me, and know that I love you
Galia, take Bob’s ring and place it on his finger and repeat after me:
I give you this ring as a sign that I choose you To be my lover, my partner and my best friend, to the end of my days Wear it, think of me, and know that I love you
